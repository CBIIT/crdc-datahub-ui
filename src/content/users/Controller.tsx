/**
 * Renders the correct view based on the URL and permissions-tier
 *
 * Implementation details:
 *
 * There are two types `ProfileView` "views": `users` and `profile`,
 * and based on the view type, the authenticated user will see slightly different content.
 *
 *   - `users` aka Edit User view:
 *     - allows editing `Role`, `Status`, and `Organization` for Admins,
 *       but allows Org Owners to only see that profile.
 *   - `profile` aka User Profile view:
 *     - is only shown to the authenticated user, and allows editing
 *       of `First Name` and `Last Name` only
 *
 * Most of the underlying logic is the same, hence the combination of
 * these two views into a single component. There's also a `ListView`
 * which is shown to Admins and Org Owners, and allows them to see
 * the list of users.
 *
 * @param type The type of view to render
 * @returns The UserController component
