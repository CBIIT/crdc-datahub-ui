# Overview

This document provides developer documentation on the usage of Storybook for the CRDC Submission Portal project.

# Storybook

We utilize Storybook to develop UI components in isolation. This allows us to build components in a more modular way, and to test them in isolation from the rest of the application.

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This command will start the Storybook server and open a new browser window with the Storybook UI.

Additionally, to build the static Storybook site, run:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```
