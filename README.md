## Contributing

We use Husky to run a pre-commit hook that will run ESLint and Prettier checks on staged files. If there are any issues, you will need to fix them before you can commit your changes.

If you need to bypass the pre-commit hook, you can use the Git `--no-verify` flag when committing your changes.
These same issues will still be caught by the CI/CD pipeline.
