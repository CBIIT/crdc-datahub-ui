## Contributing

We welcome any form of contributions to the CRDC Submission Portal project.

We use Husky to run a pre-commit hook that will run ESLint, Prettier, and Typechecking on staged files. If there are any issues, you will need to fix them before you can commit your changes.

If you need to bypass the pre-commit hook, you can use the Git `--no-verify` flag when committing your changes. However, this is not recommended as our CI/CD pipeline will fail if there are any issues.
